# ML-Models

This repository is dedicated to implementing and exploring various Machine Learning (ML) models. The goal is to incrementally add different ML models, starting with simple algorithms and progressing toward more complex techniques.

## Implemented Models

### 1. Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a fundamental supervised learning algorithm used for predicting continuous values. It models the relationship between a dependent variable (Y) and one or more independent variables (X) by fitting a linear equation to the data.

#### Implementation Details:
- Used the `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression` class from Scikit-Learn.
- Dataset: Housing Dataset From kaggle
- Performance Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-Squared Score

## Upcoming Models
The following ML models will be added incrementally:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Networks

Stay tuned for more updates!
